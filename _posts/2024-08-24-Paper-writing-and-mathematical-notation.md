Paper writing is one of the most important skills for graduate students. You need to convey all of the important ideas to readers and reviewers who, more likely than not, don't have much time. Mathematical notation is one of the most important ways of getting your ideas across precisely, but if you don't plan it carefully, you run the risk of violating the Geneva Convention. These are some tips to minimize the suffering of the readers.

### When possible, use LaTeX instead of Word.

LaTeX is a type-setting system that is particularly useful for papers that include math. It has a learning curve but in my experience it is superior to Word documents.
- It is much easier to write math equations using LaTeX.
- You don't have to worry about your document formatting getting messed up when you open a file on a different computer.
- You can control almost anything in the layout. There is a lower chance of mysterious surprises with LaTeX than with Word.

  My preference (and that of many academics) is to use [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/), an online LaTeX editor that allows you to collaborate with multiple people and no additional software is required beyond a web browser.
