Paper writing is one of the most important skills for graduate students. You need to convey all of the important ideas to readers and reviewers who, more likely than not, don't have much time. Mathematical notation is one of the most important ways of getting your ideas across precisely, but if you don't plan it carefully, you run the risk of violating the Geneva Convention. These are some tips to minimize the suffering of the readers.

### When possible, use LaTeX instead of Word.

### A table of notation.
